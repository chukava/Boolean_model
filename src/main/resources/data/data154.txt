The data on BC collection and the parameters filled in the online requisition form were collected through the hospital's LIS for all the three groups – the preintervention, intervention, and dedicated phlebotomist groups. The effectiveness of the multimodal intervention was evaluated by comparing the BC contamination rate and the compliance to filling of the parameters in the BC requisition form between the preintervention and intervention groups using appropriate statistical test (Chi-square test). Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A subgroup analysis was carried out to evaluate the differences in the impact of this multimodal intervention between dedicated phlebotomist group and intervention group.

The demographics of the patients, for example, age have been recorded. The study group involved adults only, the pediatric age group was excluded from the study. However, age-specific BC contamination among the adult patients was not evaluated in the present study. BC was classified as contaminated if one or more of the following organisms grew: Coagulase-negative Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) species except S. lugdunensis, aerobic spore bearers (Bacillus species except B. anthracis), diphtheroids (Corynebacterium species, except C. diphtheriae), Micrococcus species, α-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Aerococcus species, All positive cultures not classified as contaminated were considered true-positives (pathogen).[5],[10]
