In the present study, the BC contamination was found to be significantly reduced in intervention phase (i.e. both regular group [4.2%] and phlebotomist group [3.2%]) compared to preintervention group (13.7%) (P < 0.001). The contamination rate was further reduced to 3.2% in phlebotomist group as compared to regular group (4.2%). The standard guidelines such as Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommend that institutions should aim for acceptable limit of <3% contamination rate for the BC collected.[18] The literature depicts a divergence in the BC contamination rates among studies, with reported figures between 3% and 12%.[19],[20],[21],[22] Such variation in contamination rates may be partly due to the type of interventions implemented and also because of the criteria used by the studies to define contaminant.

The different studies used different interventions to reduce BC contamination – informational responses (e.g., regular E-mails mentioning the monthly contamination rates), change of skin antiseptics (e.g. chlorhexidine swabs), use of specialised BC collection set, individual feedback on rates of contamination and technique, educational intervention, and posting of dedicated phlebotomists.[11],[13],[17] Our study involved a multimodal intervention comprising educational intervention and implementing a standard protocol for BC collection. As a result, there was drastic reduction in the contamination rate of regular group as well as dedicated phlebotomist group. The rotational and shift-based posting of intern and resident doctors in our EDs was found as the most detrimental barrier to reduce BC contamination further.[12] Therefore, we carried out a pilot intervention, where a separate set of dedicated phlebotomists were posted in ED for a limited period of time during the intervention phase, who were exclusively trained on the BC collection protocol.[16] The subgroup analysis of dedicated phlebotomist group revealed that the contamination rate was further reduced to 3.2%. In concordance to this observation, various other studies in the literature also depicted that the collection of BCs through dedicated phlebotomists as the most effective intervention to reduce the contamination rate to below the CLSIs acceptable limit of <3%.[16],[23],[24] Aseptic collection of BC is a multifaceted skill that requires special training, expertise and knowledge; therefore, use of trained phlebotomists has been associated with a significant decrease in the BC contamination rate.[23] Similar to our study, there are also few other studies where higher BC contamination rates were reported in teaching hospitals, especially in EDs.[1],[3],[10],[12],[13],[16]

The studies with varied in BC contamination rate differ among each other in the criteria used to define “contaminant,” which in turn is due to the reporting practice of the laboratories. While some laboratories directly report the BC result as “contaminant” based on a list of common contaminant organisms (according to NHSN guideline) isolated in BC.[8] some other laboratories report the organism name and ask the clinicians to decide whether to consider it as a pathogen or contaminant based on clinical correlation.[11],[15] The CLSI defines contamination as a “microorganism isolated from a BC during specimen collection or processing (and was) not pathogenic for the patient from whom the blood was collected.”[18] Contamination rates provide a significant metric of the quality of a health-care facility and should be maintained at the lowest possible rate regardless of the reporting practices of the laboratories.[16]

In the intervention phase, we observed that with the reduction of contamination rate, there was a concordance increase in the percentage of BCs reported as “true positive (pathogen)” and “sterile.” BC contamination frequently leads to increase in the incidence of false-positive and false-negative results.[16] False-positive result occurs when actually the BC is sterile, but it becomes contaminated with skin commensal/colonizers during collection.[15] False-positive BCs may impulse the clinical team to intitiate treatment based on the reports (especially if the laboratory mentions on the report as “correlate clinically”), and it may have harmful effects to the patient, the healthcare facility and also to antimicrobial stewardship efforts.[17] Such false-positive BCs may result in unnecessary prolongation of antimicrobial therapy to the patient, extended hospital stay, and augmented financial burden.[16] At the same time, release of false-negative BCs (i.e., contaminants overgrowing or supressing the isolation of pathogens) also has detrimental effect on the patient due to delay in both diagnosis and initiation of appropriate pathogen-directed therapy.[17]

Source of blood culture contamination.

Analysis of the frequency distribution of organisms in the contaminated specimens revealed that CoNS accounted for the majority of the contaminants, followed by aerobic spore bearers, micrococci, and diphtheroids In concordance, several other studies also revealed that CoNS and aerobic spore bearers were the predominant contaminant isolated in the BCs.[25] Isolation of these organisms in BCs indicate that the source of BC contamination is either, – (i) patient's own skin flora (due to inappropriate skin decontamination during collection), or (ii) from HCWs' hands (due to inadequate hand disinfection), or (iii) very rarely from the hospital environment.[22],[25]

Compliance to blood culture collection protocol.

We also evaluated the compliance of HCWs to the BC collection protocol. Compared to preintervention group, both in regular and phlebotomist groups of intervention phase, there was a significant improvement in the compliance of HCWs to draw BCs in pairs ([36.5% vs. 79.5% and 86.0%] [P ≤ 0.01]). Various studies showed that the collection of paired or multiple BCs result in improvement in pathogen isolation and also helps in differentiating contaminants from pathogens.[15],[16],[17] In our study also, we noted that there was an improvement in pathogen isolation rate, both in regular and phlebotomist groups, which may be partly attributed to the increase in compliance of HCWs to draw BCs in pairs.

The compliance of HCWs to collect appropriate blood volume was also significantly increased from 35.9% in preintervention group to 39.1% and 71.2% in regular and phlebotomist groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Collection of an appropriate amount of blood is crucial in optimizing the pathogen detection in BCs.[15] In this context, whenever possible, 8–10 mL of blood per BC bottle should be obtained for adult patients suspected of having BSI. Both underfilling and overfilling BC vials have been associated with delay in time-to-positivity, increased contamination, false-negative, and/or false-positive results.[15],[16],[17]

Following the multimodal intervention, there was an increase in the compliance of HCW to collect the BCs before the administration of antibiotics, from 81.7% in preintervention group to 90.5% and 94% in regular and phlebotomist groups, respectively. The concept of culture of culture is extremely important in order to achieve a better yield of pathogen isolation in culture.[11],[13] Collection of culture afters the antibiotic start is found to be associated with poor recovery of the organism from the clinical specimen.[15] The improvement in pathogen isolation rate both in intervention and phlebotomist groups in our study could be partly attributed to increase in the compliance of HCWs to collect BCs before antibiotic start.[16]

Compliance to filling of various parameters in the blood culture requisition form.

During the preintervention phase, it was often found that there was irregularities in the filling of various parameters in the BC requisition form such as clinician's details, diagnosis, and source of blood collection.[19] Information on these clinical and patient-related parameters is critical for the clinical microbiological reporting of BC investigations and susceptibility testing reports by the laboratory.[11] Through the educational interventions, we found that there was an improvement in filling of all the above-mentioned parameters of the BC requisition form by our clinical team.[19] Adequate provision of the clinical team detail and the in-hospital location of the patient help in fostering effective communication between the laboratory and the clinical team.[10] When the clinical diagnosis is indicated in the requisition form, it helps the laboratory to ascertain the site-specific pathogenicity of the organisms and thereafter including appropriate site-specific antimicrobials for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.[6] Mentioning the source of collection of blood (central line or venepuncture) will guide the laboratory to differentiate between colonizers and pathogens, and also to ascertain the microbiological diagnosis of catheter-related blood stream infection.[14]


   Conclusions	 	Top


Although BCs have been a potentially life-saving diagnostic test for decades, yet the problem pertaining to the collection procedures of BC still persist, which results in increased contamination that in turn leads to unintended consequences to patients such as prolonged antibiotic exposure, increased diagnostic testing, and prolonged periods of hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality.[1] In this study, we found that implementation of a comprehensive multimodal intervention resulted in a drastic reduction in BC contamination and improvement in compliance to BC collection protocol and filling of various parameters in the BC requisition form and thus improving the overall effectiveness of BC testing.[19] We also observed that the contamination rate was further reduced to within the acceptable limit of CLSIs recommendation by implementing a dedicated trained phlebotomist for BC collection.[16] We, therefore, conclude that the clinical microbiology laboratory should be preemptive in instituting policies and providing direction to the clinical team with respect to optimizing the BC collection protocol.[24]
