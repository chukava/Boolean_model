The history of life on Earth traces the processes by which organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago.[142][143] The dating of the Earth's history can be done using several geological methods such as stratigraphy, radiometric dating, and paleomagnetic dating.[144] Based on these methods, geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years.[144] Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago[145] being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.[144] These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary) and each period into epochs.[144]

The similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor.[146] Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.[147][10][148][149] Microbal mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early Archean epoch and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.[150] The earliest evidence of eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago,[151][152] and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions.[153]

Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago,[154] although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago.[155] Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event.[156]

Ediacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period,[157] while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion.[158] During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, dominated the land,[159] but most of this group became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.[160] During the recovery from this catastrophe, archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates;[161] one archosaur group, the dinosaurs, dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[162] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs,[163] mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity.[164] Such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.[165]

Bacteria – Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (-=1 Micrometer)
Bacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[166] and the deep biosphere of the earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory.[167]


Archaea – Halobacteria
Archaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), a term that has fallen out of use.[168] Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi.[169] Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes,[170] including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores.

The first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.

Archaea are a major part of Earth's life. They are part of the microbiota of all organisms. In the human microbiome, they are important in the gut, mouth, and on the skin.[171] Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and syntrophic communities, for example.[172]

Protists
Further information: protistology diversity of protists
Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern day eukaryotic cells.[173] The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.[173] Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals.[173] While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor),[174] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience.[173][175] Most protists are unicellular, which are also known as microbial eukaryotes.[173]

The alveolates are mostly photosynthetic unicellular protists that possess sacs called alveoli (hence their name alveolates) that are located beneath their cell membrane, providing support for the cell surface.[173] Alveolates comprise several groups such as dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates. Dinoflagellates are photosynthetic and can be found in the ocean where they play a role as primary producers of organic matter.[173] Apicomplexans are parasitic alveolates that possess an apical complex, which is a group of organelles located in the apical end of the cell.[173] This complex allows apicomplexans to invade their hosts' tissues. Ciliates are alveolates that possess numerous hair-like structure called cilia. A defining characteristic of ciliates is the presence of two types of nuclei in each ciliate cell. A commonly studied ciliate is the paramecium.[173]

The excavates are groups of protists that began to diversify approximately 1.5 billion years ago shortly after the origin of the eukaryotes.[173] Some excavates do not possess mitochondria, which are thought to have been lost over the course of evolution as these protists still possess nuclear genes that are associated with mitochondria.[173] The excavates comprise several groups such as diplomonads, parabasalids, heteroloboseans, euglenids, and kinetoplastids.[173]

Stramenopiles, most of which can be characterized by the presence of tubular hairs on the longer of their two flagella, include diatoms and brown algae.[173] Diatoms are primary producers and contribute about one-fifth of all photosynthetic carbon fixation, making them a major component of phytoplankton.[173]

Rhizarians are mostly unicellular and aquatic protists that typically contain long, thin pseudopods.[173] The rhizarians comprise three main groups: cercozoans, foraminiferans, and radiolarians.[173]

Amoebozoans are protists with a body form characterized by the presence lobe-shaped pseudopods, which help them to move.[173] They include groups such as loboseans and slime molds (e.g., plasmodial slime mold and cellular slime molds).[173]

Diversity of plants
Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae, which would exclude fungi and some algae. A shared derived trait (or synapomorphy) of Plantae is the primary endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium into an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which gave rise to chloroplasts.[176] The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related.[176] Algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae.[176] Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts.[176]

Land plants (embryophytes) first appeared in terrestrial environments approximately 450 to 500 million years ago.[176] A synapomorphy of land plants is an embryo that develops under the protection of tissues of its parent plant.[176] Land plants comprise ten major clades, seven of which constitute a single clade known as vascular plants (or tracheophytes) as they all have tracheids, which are fluid-conducting cells, and a well-developed system that transports materials throughout their bodies.[176] In contrast, the other three clades are nonvascular plants as they do not have tracheids.[176] They also do not constitute a single clade.[176]

Nonvascular plants include liverworts, mosses, and hornworts. They tend to be found in areas where water is readily available.[176] Most live on soil or even on vascular plants themselves. Some can grow on bare rock, tree trunks that are dead or have fallen, and even buildings.[176] Most nonvascular plants are terrestrial, with a few living in freshwater environments and none living in the oceans.[176]

The seven clades (or divisions) that make up vascular plants include horsetails and ferns, which together can be grouped as a single clade called monilophytes.[176] Seed plants (or spermatophyte) comprise the other five divisions, four of which are grouped as gymnosperms and one is angiosperms. Gymnosperms includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[177] Angiosperms are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species.[178] Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by having characteristics such as flowers, endosperm within their seeds, and production of fruits that contain the seeds.

Fungi

Diversity of fungi. Clockwise from top left: Amanita muscaria, a basidiomycete; Sarcoscypha coccinea, an ascomycete; bread covered in mold; chytrid; Aspergillus conidiophore.
Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that digest foods outside of their bodies.[179] They do so through a process called absorptive heterotrophy whereby they would first secrete digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also saprobes as they are able to take in nutrients from dead organic matter and are hence, the principal decomposers in ecological systems.[179] Some fungi are parasites by absorbing nutrients from living hosts while others are mutualists.[179] Fungi, along with two other lineages, choanoflagellates and animals, can be grouped as opisthokonts. A synapomorphy that distinguishes fungi from other two opisthokonts is the presence of chitin in their cell walls.[179]

Most fungi are multicellular but some are unicellular such as yeasts, which live in liquid or moist environments and are able to absorb nutrients directly into their cell surfaces.[179] Multicellular fungi, on the other hand, have a body called mycelium, which is composed of a mass of individual tubular filaments called hyphae that allows for nutrient absorption to occur.[179]

Fungi can be divided into six major groups based on their life cycles: microsporidia, chytrids, zygospore fungi (Zygomycota), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota), sac fungi (Ascomycota), and club fungi (Basidiomycota).[179] Fungi are classified by the particular processes of sexual reproduction they use. The usual cellular products of meiosis during sexual reproduction are spores that are adapted to survive inclement times and to spread. A principal adaptive benefit of meiosis during sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota was proposed to be the repair of DNA damage through meiotic recombination.[180]

The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species.[181] Of these, only about 148,000 have been described,[182] with over 8,000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans.[183]
