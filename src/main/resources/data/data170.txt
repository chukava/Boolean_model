Etiology.

Several causes of SRV were noted in this review. All the authors noted pre-procedure supra-systemic RV pressure, while some authors encountered this scenario when they tried to manipulate a catheter across the RVOT during the performance of RV angiogram.[7] Furthermore, timing during BVP could also be considered as an important cause of SRV. For instance, Al Kasab et al.[8] had prolonged balloon inflation in one of his six patients who later developed SRV.

In addition, it has been noted that though dynamic infundibular obstruction otherwise call SRV is rare, however, it is not uncommon after BPV especially if the intravascular volume is very low.[9] However, its occurrence in catheter manipulation is very possible, especially during catheter manipulation across the RVOT. It is therefore advisable to be aware of such a possibility so that one can take timely corrective steps to avert fatal complications.[9]

Sudden RVOT obstruction, or “suicide right ventricle,” was also seen in the subpopulation of patients undergoing lung transplants.[10],[11] The patients had Eisenmenger's syndrome from VSD with RVOT obstruction as an initial indication for the lung transplant, both patients suffered progressive deterioration and hemodynamic instability from sudden spasm of RVOT.[10] This spasm arose from the use of probes during trans-oesophageal echocardiography. Myectomy was done to relieve this sudden spasm in the RVOT but only one patient survived. It is therefore very expedient to have a very high index of suspicion for this event during the intraoperative performance of trans-oesophageal echocardiography, as well as during direct gradient measurement.[9],[10]

SRV had also been confirmed in young adult with eisenmenger's syndrome who had closure of a patent ductus arteriosus, closure of a mid-muscular VSD and peri-membranous ventricular septal defect with bilateral lung transplantation.[10] There was an episode of severe RVOT obstruction, i.e., SRV causing hemodynamic collapse The patient recovered after Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation and relief of RVOT obstruction with a RV outflow muscle resection and a patch at the outflow tract.[10],[11]
