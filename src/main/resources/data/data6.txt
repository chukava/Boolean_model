Human activities are damaging and degrading the lands of the Earth in an unsustainable fashion according to a new UN report.

Up to 40% of the global terrain has already been devalued, mainly through modern agriculture.

If nothing changes, then an additional area of land the size of South America will be damaged by 2050.

But if lands are restored and protected, they could help contain climate change and species loss.

This second edition of the Global Land Outlook has been five years in the making, and it examines how the world is managing land resources such as soil, water and biodiversity.

A major focus is the degradation of the lands of the Earth. This means the actions that are causing the land's overall health to decline, become less fertile, store less carbon and be able to support fewer species.

The report outlines the damage that's already been done but also offers hope that improvements in how we manage the land environment can offer a better future.

Right now, around half the world's population is affected by the degradation of our lands.

Land by the numbers

Just 1% of farms control 70% of the world's agricultural land, while 80% of all farms are under 2 hectares.
Around $700bn is paid in agricultural subsidies each year but only around 15% has a positive impact on natural capital or biodiversity.
At least 70% of the clearing of forested areas for agriculture between 2013 and 2019 was done in violation of national laws.
Food systems have been the single biggest cause of damage - being responsible for 80% of the deforestation and 70% of freshwater use.

If things continue as they are then an extra 16 million square kilometres will be degraded by 2050. That's an area the size of South America.

Business as usual would also see a long-term decline in yield for 12-14% of agricultural, pasture and grazing land and natural areas - with sub-Saharan Africa worst affected.

"We cannot continue to just take land for granted," said Ibrahim Thiaw, who is the executive secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
