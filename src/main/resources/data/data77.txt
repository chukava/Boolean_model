Business magnate Elon Musk revealed that he had bought 9.1% of Twitter for $2.64 billion on April 4, 2022.[143][144][145] In response, Twitter's stock rose by as much as 27% and Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since Twitter's IPO in 2013.[146] Musk was offered a seat on Twitter's board of directors as part of a deal that prohibited him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company,[144][147] but Musk decided not to join the board before his appointment became effective on April 9.[148]

Musk then made an unsolicited offer on April 14 to acquire Twitter for $43 billion and take the company private,[149] saying that he believed in the importance of free speech for democracy around the world. In a TED interview, Musk showed little interest in fighting internet censorship around the world, saying that "Twitter should match the laws of the country". Instead, Musk's concern about free speech has been directed almost entirely at Twitter's moderation policies.[150][151] Twitter's board introduced a "poison pill" strategy on April 15, which would allow shareholders to buy additional stock should a hostile takeover occur as a means to block Musk's takeover.[152] On April 20, Musk secured $46.5 billion as a tender offer to buy Twitter.[153][154] On April 25, it was reported that Twitter was prepared to accept Musk's offer,[155] with the board publicly accepting the offer later that day.[156]

Musk has stated that his first plan is to open-source the algorithm that ranks tweets in the content feed, in order to increase transparency. He has stated intention to remove the spam bots, and to authenticate all real humans.[157]

Leadership
As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[158] On October 16, 2008,[159] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board.[160] On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO. On October 4, 2010, Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and "be completely focused on product strategy".[161][162]

According to The New York Times, "Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship" when Williams was away.[163] According to PC Magazine, Williams was "no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company". He was focused on developing a new startup, and became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to "help in any way [he could]". In 2011, Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an "advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy".[164] In January 2014, Stone announced the release of Jelly, a 'social Q&A network for mobile'.[165] Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. At that time, he split his schedule with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.[163]

In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's board of directors.[166] In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired former Google executive Matt Derella to become their new director of business agency development.[167] Twitter named former Goldman Sachs executive Anthony Noto as the company's CFO in July 2014, with an "annual salary of $250,000 and one-time restricted stock options of 1.5 million shares ... valued at $61.5 million".[168] On June 10, 2015, Twitter announced its CEO Dick Costolo would resign on July 1, 2015.[169] Noto was said to be considered a potential replacement for outgoing CEO Costolo.[170] On October 14, 2015, former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani became executive chairman, replacing Dorsey who remains CEO.[171] On January 26, 2016, Leslie Berland, former executive vice president of global advertising, marketing, and digital partnerships at American Express, was named chief marketing officer.[172] In November 2016, COO Adam Bain announced his resignation and CFO Anthony Noto took over Bain's role.[173][174] A month later, on December 20, 2016, CTO Adam Messinger announced that he too was leaving.[175][176]

In February 2020, it was reported that Elliott Management Corporation had acquired a stake in Twitter, with activist shareholder and Republican Party supporter Paul Singer expected to seek the removal of Dorsey as CEO.[177] Twitter agreed to appoint a new independent director and two new board members, and to perform $2 billion in share buybacks.[178]
