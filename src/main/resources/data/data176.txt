Musk is an active user of the social media platform Twitter, where he has over 80 million followers.[244] Musk made the first tweet on his personal account in June 2010.[245][246] He posts memes, promotes his business interests, and sometimes comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[247]

Musk has faced some controversy as a result of his use of the platform. In August 2018, he claimed in a tweet that he was taking Tesla private at $420 per share, a joking reference to marijuana. An SEC investigation concluded that the tweets had no basis in fact and hurt investors, resulting in separate fines to Musk and Tesla of $20 million each. The settlement also included a clause that Musk would have legal counsel approve tweets about Tesla in advance. In 2022, he was also sued by Tesla shareholders over the tweet. Musk maintains that the joke was "worth it".[248] In 2020, a tweet by Musk stating that "Tesla stock price is too high" reduced the company's value by $14 billion. Musk encountered further troubles in 2021, when he tweeted a poll about whether to sell 10% of his stock in the company, before doing so. This resulted in an SEC insider trading investigation into Musk and his brother Kimbal, relating to whether Musk told his brother in advance that he would tweet the poll.[248] Other points of controversy have included his tweets about cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin and Ethereum, which have caused their values to fluctuate,[249][250] as well as tweets downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and criticizing lockdowns, including one comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler over vaccine mandates.[248]

Musk tweeted as early as 2017 expressing interest in buying the platform.[248] On January 31, 2022, Musk began steadily buying significant quantities of shares in the company, reaching a 5% stake in the company on March 14, 2022.[251] Musk reached a total of 73,115,038 shares on April 1, 9.13% of Twitter's overall shares, valued at the time at $2.64 billion, making him the largest shareholder in the company. Musk did not file paperwork to notify the SEC within 10 days of when his stake in the company surpassed 5%, a violation of US securities laws.[252] When Musk publicly disclosed his investment in a Securities and Exchange Commission 13G filing on April 4, 2022, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since its IPO in 2013 as a flurry of trading activity resulted in the share price increasing by as much as 27%.[244] The revelation that Musk had acquired a significant stake in Twitter followed Musk's tweets on March 25 and 26 in which he questioned Twitter's commitment to freedom of speech[253] and said that he was considering developing a rival social media site,[254][255][256] although the comments were made after he had already acquired 7.5% of the company.[251][257]

On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would see him appointed to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company,[258][259] but Musk decided not to join the board before his appointment became effective on April 9.[260] On April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share. In a letter to Twitter's board, he indicated his desire to take the company private: "[Twitter] will neither thrive nor serve [its free speech] societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."[261][262][263] In response, Twitter's board adopted a shareholder rights plan to make it significantly more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without approval of the board.[264][265] In a TED interview, Musk showed little interest in fighting internet censorship around the world, saying that "Twitter should match the laws of the country". Instead, Musk's concern about free speech has been directed almost entirely at Twitter's moderation policies.[266][267]

On April 20, Musk secured funding worth $46.5 billion.[268] The funding included $12.5 billion in loans against Musk's stock in Tesla, and $21 billion in equity financing, such as from selling Tesla shares.[269][270] On April 25, it was reported that Twitter was prepared to accept Musk's offer.[271] Later that same day, Elon Musk successfully concluded his bid to buy Twitter and bring the company private for approximately $44 billion.[272][273][274] In a statement, Musk said:[275][276]
Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated, I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential—I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.[277][278]

Tesla's stock sunk by more than $125 billion the next day in reaction to the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth.[279][280] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them to engage in sexist and racist harassment against her.[281]

At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[284] By the year's end his net worth had increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[285] During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[286] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[287] In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[288] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[289] On September 27, 2021, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world, after Tesla stock surged.[290] In November 2021, Musk became the first person with a net worth over $300 billion.[291]

Around three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla.[287] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[285] The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.[292] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board.[293] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[293][292]

Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[294] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[295] His 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.[294]

Musk has repeatedly described himself as "cash poor",[296][297] and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".[296] In 2012, Musk signed The Giving Pledge and, in May 2020, pledged to "sell almost all physical possessions".[297][298] In 2021, Musk defended his wealth by saying he is "accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary [and] extend the light of consciousness to the stars".[299] In the early 2000s, Musk was[clarification needed] a private pilot, his favorite aircraft then being the L-39 Albatros, though he decided to stop piloting by 2008.[300][301] He uses a private jet owned by SpaceX[302][303] and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[304] The jet's heavy use of fossil fuels—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—has received criticism.[302][305]
