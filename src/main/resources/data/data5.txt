"And a temporary freeze on new oil palm plantations was not renewed last year."

While the data from Indonesia and Malaysia is positive, the overall picture is not going in the right direction.

At COP26 in Glasgow last Autumn, some 141 countries committed to "halt and reverse forest loss by 2030."

This will require significant and rapid action in many countries that isn't evident at present.

One of the biggest concerns is that despite the best efforts of many governments to preserve the forests, a rapidly changing climate could upend their good work.

"Wildfires are often linked to the hotter, drier conditions that climate change is bringing, which compound the similar local effects of deforestation itself," said Frances Seymour, from WRI.

"And this loss of forest resilience is edging us closer and closer to tipping points, such as the wholesale conversion of the Amazon rainforest to a savanna grassland that would release enough carbon into the atmosphere to blow the Paris Agreement goals right out of the water."

The data has been compiled by Global Forest Watch, World Resources Institute and the University of Maryland.
