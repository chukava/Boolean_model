Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University, and they married in 2000.[414] He contracted malaria in 2000 while on vacation in South Africa, and nearly died.[415] In 2002, their first child, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[416] After his death, the couple decided to use IVF to continue their family.[417] Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in April 2004, followed by triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006.[417] The couple divorced in 2008 and share custody of their five sons.[414][418][419]

In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[420] They married in September 2010 at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[421][422] In 2012, he announced a divorce from Riley.[423][424][425] In 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, he filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[426] A second divorce was finalized in 2016.[427] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[428][429] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[429] Musk was later accused by Johnny Depp of having an affair with Heard while she was still married to Depp.[430][431][432] Musk and Heard both denied the affair.[433]

In May 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[434][435][436] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[437][438] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was "X Æ A-12"; however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[439][440] and was then changed to "X Æ A-Xii". This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.[441] The child was eventually named "X AE A-XII" Musk, with "X" as a first name, "AE A-XII" as a middle name, and "Musk" as surname.[442] Musk confirmed reports that the couple are "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[443][444][445] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid." She further revealed that their first daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, nicknamed Y, was born in December 2021 via surrogate.[2] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again "but he's my best friend and the love of my life."[446]

From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded and where their headquarters are still located.[447] In 2020, he moved to Texas, stating that California had become "complacent" with its economic success.[447][448] During his hosting of Saturday Night Live in May 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome.[449]
