esla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[95] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[96] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[97][98] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[99] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[100][101] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[102] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[103][104] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[105] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.[106]

Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[107] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[108] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[109][110] A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[111][112] The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[113][114] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[115] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[116] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, Gigafactory 3 in China, Gigafactory 4 in Germany and Gigafactory 5 in Texas.[117][118][119][120][121]


Musk at the 2019 Tesla annual shareholder meeting
Since its initial public offering in 2010,[122] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[123][124] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[125][126] In October 2021 it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.[127] On November 6, 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".[128][129] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock in the week ending November 12,[128] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[130] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[131]

SEC lawsuit
In September 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC[132] for a tweet claiming funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[133][note 4] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[133][137][138] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[139][140]

Musk has stated in interviews he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[141][142] On February 19, 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[143] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[144] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[145] In May 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[146][147] FOIA released records showing that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".[148]

Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive co-founded in 2006.[149] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[150] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[151] Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020 when Panasonic departed.[152][153]

Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery energy storage products division to create Tesla Energy.
