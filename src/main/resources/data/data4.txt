This is a key concern for climate researchers who fear that the Brazilian rainforest may be approaching a tipping point when it emits more carbon than it stores, which would be a very negative development in limiting the rise in global temperatures this century.

There are also growing worries about trees losses in Bolivia where over two thirds of the clearance of trees was linked to large scale agriculture such as cattle ranching.

However, there is some good news in the data, with Indonesia curbing tree losses for the fifth year in a row.

There are several factors behind this success.

The government has put in place a permanent moratorium on converting primary forest and peat land for palm oil. They've also included a commitment in their national climate plan to reduce emissions from forests so they become a carbon sink and not a source by 2030.

They've also been helped by industry actions, with deforestation for palm oil at a 20 year low, while commitments to stop clearing new lands have also been tightened for the pulp and paper industry.

But there are some concerns that things in Indonesia could change for the worse in coming years.

"The palm oil price is currently at a 40-year high and this might increase the appetite to expand palm oil plantation areas," said Hidayah Hamza, from WRI Indonesia.
