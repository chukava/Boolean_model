In July 2020, Musk tweeted "Pronouns suck" to significant backlash on Twitter, including from his partner Grimes.[357][358][359] The tweet has been perceived by some as transphobic and an attack on non-binary gender identities.[360] In a series of December 2020 tweets, Musk again mocked the use of preferred gender pronouns. The Human Rights Campaign, which had previously given Tesla the number one ranking on its Corporate Equality Index, criticized his tweets and called for an apology.[361][362]

Public transportation

"There is this premise that good things must be somehow painful. I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time."

"It's a pain in the ass, that's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want."

When the audience member responded that public transportation seemed to work in Japan, Musk shot back, "What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn't sound great."

His comments have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, which have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient and requires much less space than private cars.[369][370][366]

Musk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies; instead they should use a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.[371][372] Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.[373] His stance has been called hypocritical as his businesses have received billions of dollars in subsidies.[374][375] In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero emissions credits offered in California and the United States federal level, which enabled improved initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in relative comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine vehicles.[376] Notably, Tesla generates a sizeable portion of its revenue from its sales of carbon credits granted to the company, by both the European Union Emissions Trading System and the Chinese national carbon trading scheme.[377][378][379][380]

Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[381][382] Musk's opposition to short-selling has been speculated to stem from how short-sellers often organize and publish opposition research about the companies that they believe are currently overvalued.[383] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[384][385] Musk has also regularly promoted cryptocurrencies, stating that he supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[386] Given the volatile effects that his tweets about them have,[387] his statements around cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulations by critics such as Nouriel Roubini.[388]

Musk has voiced concerns about human population decline,[389][390] saying that "Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization."[391] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in December 2021, Musk stated that declining birth rates and population is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[392]


In a December 2021 interview with Christian conservative satirical website The Babylon Bee, Musk lamented that it was "increasingly difficult to get things done" in California. Musk had sold enough to reach his goal of selling 10% of his shares in Tesla (then the world's most valuable car company), partially to pay taxes, and relocated his personal and Tesla's tax residence from California to Texas in order to avoid state income tax. Musk said that "California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is... becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation."[393] In the same interview, he stated, "At its heart wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful. It basically gives mean people... a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false virtue."[394]

Musk condemned the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and announced measures to support Ukraine's defense, such as providing the country with free Starlink access, for which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy personally thanked Musk while announcing further talks between the two.[395][396]

Starlink has been told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources. We will not do so unless at gunpoint.

Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.

After some governments had asked Starlink to block access to Russian news sources in response to the invasion of Ukraine, Musk identified himself as a "free speech absolutist" and said "we will not do so unless at gunpoint".[398][399]
