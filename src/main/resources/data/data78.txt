Tweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to only their followers. Users can mute users they do not wish to interact with, block accounts from viewing their tweets and remove accounts from their followers list.[181][182][183] Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries.[184] Users may subscribe to other users' tweets—this is known as "following" and subscribers are known as "followers"[185] or "tweeps", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps.[186] Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a "retweet". In 2015, Twitter launched "quote tweet" (originally called "retweet with comment"),[187] a feature that allows users to add a comment to their retweet, nesting one tweet in the other.[188] Users can also "like" (formerly "favorite") individual tweets.[189]

The counters for "likes", "retweets", and replies appear next to the respective buttons in timelines such as on profile pages and search results. Counters for likes and retweets exist on a tweet's standalone page too. Since September 2020, quote tweets, formerly known as "retweet with comment", have an own counter on their tweet page.[187] Until the legacy desktop front end that was discontinued in 2020, a row with miniature profile pictures of up to ten liking or retweeting users was displayed (earliest documented implementation in December 2011 overhaul), as well as a tweet reply counter next to the according button on a tweet's page.[190][191]

Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets.[192] Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.[193] In a 2009 Time magazine essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as "remarkably simple":

As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page. If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.[194]

Hashtags, usernames, retweets and replies
"Twitter hashtag" redirects here. For more about hashtags, see Hashtag.
Further information: Mention (blogging) § @ (At sign)
Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a "#" sign. Similarly, the "@" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users.[195]

In 2014, in anticipation for the FIFA World Cup, Twitter introduced hashflags, special hashtags that automatically generate a custom emoji next to them for a certain period of time, following the success of a similar campaign during the 2010 World Cup.[196] Hashflags may be generated by Twitter themselves (such as to raise awareness for social issues)[197] or be purchased by corporations (such as to promote products and events).[198]

To repost a message from another Twitter user and share it with one's own followers, a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet. Users can reply other accounts' replies. Since November 2019, users can hide replies to their messages. Since May 2020, users can select who can reply each of their tweets before sending them: anyone, accounts who follow the poster, specific accounts, and none. This ability was upgraded in July 2021 to make the feature retroactively applicable to tweets after they have been sent out.[199][200]

Using SMS
Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for international use. There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2[201] and Orange[202] networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel,[203] an alternative platform called smsTweet[204] was set up by a user to work on all networks.[205] A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.[206]

The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, tinyurl.com, tr.im, and other content-hosting services such as TwitPic, memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its site, making other link shorteners unnecessary for staying within Twitter's 140 character limit.[207][208]

In April 2020, Twitter discontinued the ability to receive SMS messages containing the text of new tweets in most countries.[209][210]

Character limits
In 2016, Twitter announced that media such as photos, videos, and the person's handle, would not count against the already constrictive 140 character limit. A user photo post used to count for a large chunk of a Tweet, about 24 characters.[211] Attachments and links would also no longer be part of the character limit.[212]

Since March 30, 2017, the Twitter handles are outside the tweet itself, therefore they no longer count towards the character limit.[213] Only new Twitter handles added to the conversation count towards the limit.

In 2017, Twitter doubled their historical 140-character-limitation to 280.[214] Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from: most European letters and punctuation forms count as one character, while each CJK glyph counts as two so that only 140 such glyphs can be used in a tweet.[214]

URL shortener
t.co is a URL shortening service created by Twitter.[207] It is only available for links posted to Twitter and not available for general use.[207] All links posted to Twitter use a t.co wrapper.[215] Twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites,[207] and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets.[207][216]

Having used the services of third parties TinyURL and bit.ly,[217] Twitter began experimenting with its own URL shortening service for private messages in March 2010 using the twt.tl domain,[215] before it purchased the t.co domain. The service was tested on the main site using the accounts @TwitterAPI, @rsarver and @raffi.[215] On September 2, 2010, an email from Twitter to users said they would be expanding the roll-out of the service to users. On June 7, 2011, Twitter announced that it was rolling out the feature.[208]

Integrated photo-sharing service
On June 1, 2011, Twitter announced its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com.[218] Users now also have the ability to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet.[219] Twitter also plans to provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.[219]
