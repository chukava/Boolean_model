Suicidal right ventricle (SRV) is a term used for a clinical situation where right ventricular (RV) infundibular spasm results in hemodynamic collapse following relief of pulmonary valvar stenosis either by balloon valvotomy or surgical valvotomy.[1] The prevalence of SRV is not known, this is because it is a rare and dangerous occurrence in cardiology practice. SRV is an uncommon anomaly in children and adults that can result in death. It normally occurs when there is a very severe RV outflow spasm or obstruction. For instance, in severe pulmonary valvar stenosis, after relief with balloon valvuloplasty, there could be a build-up of supra-systemic RV pressure and this can lead to low cardiac output.[1] This phenomenon can also occur during lung transplant for Eisenmenger syndrome.[2] SRV could occur spontaneously, especially iatrogenic causes, but it can be rare in children. It is very dangerous and very prominent when closing acyanotc heart lesions such as PDA, VSD, or ASD that has undergone Eisenmenger syndrome.[3],[4]

There are very few studies on this topic with varying etiology and much is not known about how deleterious this episode can be. A careful search in the literature showed that this is the first time a systematic review on this rare event is been undertaken. The systematic review is therefore aimed at ascertaining different scenarios that can precipitate SRV in cardiology practice. We also highlighted possible complications, management, and outcome of this episodic event.
