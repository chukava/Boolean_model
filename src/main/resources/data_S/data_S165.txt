Decisions regarding enteral nutrition in advanced dementia remain ethically challenging for all involved [4]. One challenge is the possible complications of enteral nutrition including aspiration pneumonia and fluid overload [13,18]. Further challenges include understanding the patientâ€™s wishes as they may be unable to communicate and are unlikely to have documented their wishes through advance directives or advance care plans [19,20].
However, evidence suggests the continued use of enteral nutrition in the older population with dementia. A study in the United States found 34% of nursing home residents received enteral nutrition [21] and 30% of PEG insertions were estimated to be in people with dementia [22]. In Japan, elderly people receiving enteral nutrition is on the increase [23]. Many studies and reviews have been completed exploring the immediate clinical effects of enteral nutrition for people with advanced dementia [13,14,15,24]. However, methodologies, focus and outcomes of these studies have begun to change and the need to explore further risk factors for patients with dementia receiving enteral nutrition is required. Therefore the aim of this review is to explore recent data on both physical and nutritional outcomes and the impact on quality of life of patients with dementia receiving enteral nutrition.
Objectives:
Evaluate the impact of enteral nutrition on mortality, risk factors for mortality, pressure sores, aspiration pneumonia and nutritional parameters for patients with dementia.
Evaluate the impact of enteral nutrition on quality of life for patients with dementia.
