Conclusions.
The results of our study highlight that victims of any type of violence in close relationships have a worse QoL and higher levels of psychological distress than non-victims. These findings provide useful evidence that the complexities of close-relationship violence constitute a serious public health problem. In addition, our results underline that violence is not only a mental health issue but also interacts with victimsâ€™ subjective well-being. Some of the differences in QoL are driven by the perpetrator being in a close relationship.

Thus, our findings have important policy implications for developing different preventive strategies according to the victim-perpetrator relationship. Early detection of violence in close relationships needs urgent action in primary health care settings to improve the QoL and prevent severe mental health consequences among women. Our findings could also apply to health education among adolescents, which is pivotal to preventing violence, psychosocial distress, and substance abuse.
