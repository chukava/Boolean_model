Blood cultures (BCs) remain the most definite investigation in any patient with suspected bloodstream infections (BSIs) and sepsis. BCs have long been recognized as one of the critically important and potentially life-saving diagnostic tests performed in clinical microbiology laboratories.[1],[2] Sample collection for BC is a technically demanding procedure. Strict asepsis is followed during collection to prevent the growth of skin commensals/colonizers or environmental contaminants, which may overgrow and hence mask the actual pathogens in the blood if present, thus delaying or preventing the diagnosis of true bacteremia.[3] Furthermore, the growth of commensals/contaminants creates confusion for both clinicians and laboratorians, which may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial usage due to spurious diagnosis.[4],[5],[6] Unfortunately, BC collection is often found to have fallacies inappropriate skin asepsis (leading to frequent contamination), or are collected in insufficient volume, inadequate number of BC bottles, or collected after institution of antimicrobials.[7],[8],[9] The preanalytical errors in BC collection result in several detrimental outcomes such as delay in identification of bacteremia and initiation of pathogen-directed therapy, ordering of more investigations resulting in increased financial burden, and increased morbidity and mortality.[10],[11],[12]

Although errors in BC collection have been reported in all areas of the hospital, it is more profound in the emergency department (ED). Several studies documented BC contamination as a significant problem in ED.[1],[3],[12] This may be due to various reasons such as heterogeneity of the health-care workers (HCWs) posted, high staff turnover, lack of awareness, emergency collection, or increased work pressure.[13] Therefore, this quality improvement study was undertaken in the ED, in collaboration with the clinical microbiology team; aiming to reduce the BC contamination rate following a multimodal intervention.[3] The study also aimed to achieve a significant improvement in the compliance of clinicians to follow the correct BC collection protocol (e.g. appropriate volume, and adequate bottle numbers) and to fill various essential information/parameters in the BC requisition form following the multimodal intervention.[8]
