We cannot just continue to think that there is enough land out there, that there's enough water and forest and wetlands to destroy, to respond to our insatiable greed, so to speak, for food and fibre and animal feed."

While the Global Land Outlook report paints a challenging future if nothing changes, the picture is far more positive if governments take steps to restore and protect land.

Restoration involves planting more trees, managing grazing more effectively and assisting the natural regeneration of some areas.

If governments go beyond restoration and actively protect lands as well, this would see crop yields increase in most developing countries, limiting food price rises.

It would also bolster the ability of the soil to store carbon and water. Biodiversity losses would continue but about a third of the projected losses would be prevented.

To achieve this will take political will, but cash will also be needed.

The UNCCD point out that around $700bn are given in what they term "perverse subsidies" to the fossil fuel and agriculture industries each year.

Repurposing about a third of this money would allow governments to restore 1 billion degraded hectares by 2030, an area the size of the US.

The UN says that many regenerative agriculture practices can boost crop yields while also drawing down more carbon from the atmosphere.
