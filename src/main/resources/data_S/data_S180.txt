Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[7] His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[8][9][10] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a White South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[11][12] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[10][13] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia;[14][15][16] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[17][18] When Musk was a child, his adenoids were removed because doctors suspected that he was deaf, but his mother later decided that he was thinking "in another world."[19] The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".[12] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[17] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[20] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[20] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[14][21] Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[22]

Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[23][24] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[25][26] An awkward and introverted child,[27] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[20][28] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[29]

Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[30] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[31][32] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[33] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[34] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[35] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[36][37] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[38][39][40]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[41] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[42] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[31] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.[43]
