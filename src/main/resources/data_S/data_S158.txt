The COVID-19 disease is a respiratory disease caused by the new Coronavirus.[1] This pandemic has had severe impacts globally.[2] By the end of July 2021, more than 200 million people worldwide have been infected, and about 4.2 million have died. According to Iran's latest statistical reports, almost more than 4 million people have been infected, and more than 90 thousand have died.[3]

Human resources of the health system, especially nurses, are the first line of confrontation against COVID-19. Nurses make up 70% of the health system workforce and spend more time with the patients. They are exposed to high-risk activities such as clearing the airway and collecting laboratory samples.[4] Since the beginning of this global epidemic, nurses working in related hospitals have faced several stressors, such as work time, family distancing, and concerns about the possibility of infection. Due to the high degree of stress in the workplace, it can be expected that a percentage of nurses with greater vulnerability are at risk of mental illnesses, including anxiety disorders and depression.[5]

Anxiety is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in nurses. Health anxiety is a type of anxiety disorder and refers to worrying and anxiety regarding protection against serious diseases based on misinterpretations of body emotions or body changes as a disease.[6] The disorder consists of the emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual components, and is associated with the 4 specific dysfunctional beliefs of probability of getting or having the disease, fear of the disease, inability to cope with the disease, and insufficient medical services to treat the disease. This disorder's prevalence in nurses is estimated to be between 30% and 50%.[7],[8]

Since health anxiety is an important factor that affects the personal and professional lives of nurses and can have adverse effects on their quality of life in the long run,[9] and given that Iran is one of the centers of COVID-19 disease in the world, nurses in Iran have been affected by the consequences of this disease in recent months. On the other hand, due to the special conditions and clinical stress in the current period, the present study has been planned and implemented to investigate the level of health anxiety in nurses caring for patients with COVID-19.
