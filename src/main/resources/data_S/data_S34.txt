History
The idea of codependency may have its roots in the theories of German psychoanalyst Karen Horney. In 1941, she proposed that some people adopt what she termed a "Moving Toward" personality style to overcome their basic anxiety. Essentially, these people move toward others by gaining their approval and affection, and subconsciously control them through their dependent style. They are unselfish, virtuous, martyr-like, faithful, and turn the other cheek despite personal humiliation. Approval from others is more important than respecting themselves.[4]

The term codependency is most often identified with Alcoholics Anonymous and the realization that the Alcoholism was not solely about the addict but also about the family and friends who constitute a network for the alcoholic."[5] The term “codependent” is used to describe how family members and friends might actually interfere with recovery by overhelping."[6]

The application of this term was very much driven by the self-help community.[7] Janet G. Woititz's Adult Children of Alcoholics had come out in 1983 and sold two million copies while being on the New York Times bestseller list for 48 weeks.[7] Robin Norwood's Women Who Love Too Much, 1985, sold two and a half million copies and spawned Twelve Step groups across the country for women "addicted" to men.[7] Melody Beattie popularized the concept of codependency in 1986 with the book Codependent No More which sold eight million copies.[8] In 1986, Timmen Cermak, M.D. wrote Diagnosing and Treating Co-Dependence: A Guide for Professionals. In the book and an article published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs (Volume 18, Issue 1, 1986), Cermak argued (unsuccessfully) for the inclusion of codependency as a separate personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987).[9] Cermak's book paved the way for a Twelve-step take-off program, called Co-Dependents Anonymous.[10] The first Co-Dependents Anonymous meeting was held October 22, 1986.[10]

Definition
"Dependency" is well-established in clinical theory, research, and personality and social psychological literature.[11] Early psychoanalytic theory emphasized the oral character and structural basis of dependency, which originates from the observed dependency of the infant on the mother. Social learning theory asserts that “dependency” is either acquired by learning and experience or just an identification for types of learning. Ethological attachment theory posits that attachment or affectional bonding is the basis for positive dependency, which should be distinguished from the negatively-valenced definition posited by codependence theorists.[12]
