A total of five studies were included in the systematic review and all had an observational design. Two studies applied a prospective design [29,30] and three studies applied a retrospective design [31,32,33]. Studies were completed in Japan [31], USA [32], Sweden [29,33] and Germany [30]. Study sample sizes ranged from 119â€“484, participants were categorized with a diagnosis of dementia [31,33] or a broader definition of dementia as significant cognitive impairment and/or combined with other neurologic disorders [29,30,32]. All studies included enteral nutrition administered via PEG tubes. All studies included mortality following the commencement of enteral nutrition or the insertion of a PEG. Mortality was analysed using Kapan-Meirer analysis, which is an estimate of the number of participants who survive for a certain amount of time following a healthcare intervention [34]. Secondary outcomes included predictors of mortality, serum albumin levels, aspiration pneumonia and general complications. No studies reported outcomes relevant to pressure sores or quality of life (refer to Table 2 Summary of studies reviewed).
