Conservation

Efforts are made to preserve the natural characteristics of Hopetoun Falls, Australia, without affecting visitors' access.
Conservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.[277][278][279] It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity.[280][281][282][283] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,[284] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.[285][286] Biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. Organizations and citizens are responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.[287][280][281][282]
