Background: Suicidal right ventricle (SRV) is defined as a dynamic right ventricular outflow obstruction with a clinical hemodynamic significance. This is a rare and dangerous event in cardiology practice. Objectives: This systematic review is aimed at ascertaining different scenarios that can precipitate SRV in cardiology practice. Methods: Data for the systematic review was retrieved from Cochrane database, Google Scholar, PubMed review, Institute for Scientific Information “Web of Science,” and Medline. The search engine yielded 164 items on SRV. 148 articles were excluded thereafter because they did not meet the criteria for SRV with 16 articles left. The remaining 16 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were further assessed for eligibility and 9 were excluded further, because they did not strictly fulfill the criteria for SRV. Finally, 7 research articles were included in the systematic review and quantitative synthesis. Results: Valvar pulmonary stenosis is the most common diagnosis warranting balloon pulmonary valvotomy (BPV). There is no gender predilection for SRV; 7 males and 6 females. The age range is 5–28 years with a mean of 19.8 ± 6.6 at 95 CI. The most common etiology of SRV was caused by a prior supra systemic right ventricle. In one study, 108 patients had balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, but only 0.92% (1/108) of the patients who was >5 years developed SRV. Furthermore, out of six patients in another study who had BPV, only one (16.6%) had SRV. The commonest clinical presentation of SRV is cardiovascular collapse, the SRV was relieved in some cases by removing the offending agent (catheter) while some were treated with volume expanders and Beta-blockers. Conclusion: This review has shown that SRV is a rare abnormality in children and adults. It normally occurs during balloon valvotomy or surgical valvotomy.
